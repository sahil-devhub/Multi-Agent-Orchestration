To make your project stand out and increase your chances of winning a hackathon, you should focus on adding features that demonstrate a deep understanding of AI concepts and offer a unique user experience. Here are some ideas:

### Multi-Agent Collaboration
Instead of a single AI agent, a more advanced approach is to have a **team of specialized agents** working together. This shows a sophisticated system design.

* **Dynamic Role Assignment**: Create a primary "dispatcher" agent that analyzes the user's query and delegates the task to a more specialized agent. For example, a question about financial markets goes to a "Financial Analyst Agent," while a creative writing prompt goes to a "Creative Writer Agent."
* **Agent Teamwork**: Configure a small team of agents that can communicate with each other to solve a complex problem. For example, a user asks for a business plan, and a "Market Research Agent" gathers data while a "Business Strategist Agent" structures the report.

***

### Advanced Data Processing
Your current agent searches the web for text, which is a great start. To make it truly unique, expand its capabilities to handle other data types.

* **Multimodal Input**: Enable the user to upload an **image, video, or a document (like a PDF)**. The agent could then answer questions about the content of that media. For example, a user could upload a chart and ask, "What is the key takeaway from this graph?"
* **Structured Data Analysis**: Instead of just summarizing text, have the agent process structured data. For example, it could analyze a CSV file and present insights in a conversational summary or even generate a simple chart directly in the UI.

### Interactive and Real-time Features
A hackathon judge will be impressed by a project that feels fast and responsive.

* **Streaming Responses**: Don't wait for the entire response to be generated. **Stream the text back** to the user token by token, similar to how modern chat interfaces work. This gives the illusion of a lightning-fast agent.
* **Live Progress Indicators**: While the agent is working, show the user what it's doing. For example, display messages like "Searching the web for crypto trends..." or "Synthesizing information..." This makes the process transparent and engaging.

### Unique UI/UX
A well-designed interface can make a good project great.

* **Dynamic UI**: The UI should change based on the agent's actions. If the agent is generating code, the output box could have syntax highlighting. If it's generating a chart, the chart should appear dynamically.
* **"Personality Sliders"**: Allow the user to adjust the agent's tone or style using sliders. For example, a slider for "Formality" or "Creativity" could modify the system prompt in real-time, giving the user control over the output.

To win, it's often better to execute one or two of these unique features exceptionally well rather than trying to implement all of them. Good luck! ðŸš€
